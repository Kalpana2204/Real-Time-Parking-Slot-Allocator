 Real-Time Parking Slot Allocator

A Java-based Spring Boot project that manages real-time parking slot allocation using RESTful APIs. It follows a clean MVC architecture and uses core DSA concepts like `HashMap` for constant-time (O(1)) slot lookup and tracking. The project includes endpoints to allocate, release, and view slot status. Developed in IntelliJ, tested with Postman, and supported by an optional HTML + JavaScript frontend for browser-based interaction. Ideal for demonstrating backend logic with real-world application scenarios.
